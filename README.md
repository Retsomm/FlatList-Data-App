## **App Structure**

The Movie Explorer app has a well-organized structure, with the main functionality split into different screens and components. Here's an overview of the app's structure:

### **Main File: `App.js`**

- The **`App.js`** file serves as the entry point for the application.

- It establishes the primary navigation structure using the React Navigation library.

- The app features a bottom tab navigator with two tabs: "Mars" and "Earth."

- Each tab is associated with its own stack navigator, allowing for a stack-based navigation flow.

- Customized icons and styles are applied to enhance the user experience.

### **Mars Screen: `HomeScreen.js`**

- The "Mars" screen presents a list of movies related to Mars using a **`FlatList`** component.

- Users can select a movie to view detailed information about it.

- Each list item displays the movie title, release date, and an arrow icon for navigation.

### **Mars Detail Screen: `HomeDetailScreen.js`**

- The "Mars Detail" screen provides in-depth information about a selected Mars-related movie.

- It displays an image and an article about the movie.

- Both the image and article content are passed to the screen via **`props`**.

### **Earth Screen and Detail Screen: `ProfileScreen.js` and `ProfileDetailScreen.js`**

- These screens follow a similar structure and functionality to the "Mars" screens.

- They display information related to Earth-based movies.
